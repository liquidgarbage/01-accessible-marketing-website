# 01-accessible-marketing-website

## Description

This project involved working for a marketing agency. They wanted their site to have a codebase that follows accessibility standards and is optimised for search engines.

I assessed the HTML and CSS files. I found the HTML was non-semantic, and the CSS was repetitive.

I made the HTML more accessible by adding alt descriptions to the images and made the HTML semantic, eg. divs to sections, etc

I condensed the CSS. Instead of lots of individual classes doing the same thing. I deleted the repetitions. Then gave the remaining CSS class a descriptive and universal name.

I added clear comments to the HTML and CSS to ensure readability when worked on in the future.

Working on this project I learned about semantic HTML and the importance of accessibility. The Internet should be open and accessible to everyone. Using semantic HTML and alt-image descriptions ensures screen readers can relay information correctly.
I also learned about the importance of clean concise CSS to ensure dry efficient code.
I also learned about comments and how useful they are during, and returning to a project.
